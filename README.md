# Bank Customer Churn Prediction üè¶

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in a bank using Python. The goal is to identify key factors that influence customer churn and build a predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer details such as credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, and churn status.

## Features
- **Credit Score**: Customer's creditworthiness.
- **Geography**: Country of the customer.
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Tenure**: Number of years with the bank.
- **Balance**: Account balance.
- **Products**: Number of bank products used.
- **Has Credit Card**: Whether the customer has a credit card.
- **Is Active Member**: Customer activity status.
- **Estimated Salary**: Customer's estimated income.
- **Exited**: Churn status (0: No, 1: Yes).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Model Building
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization techniques

## Results
- Performance comparison of different models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Feature importance analysis to determine key drivers of customer churn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Amarnath-Jakapure/Bank-Customer-Churn.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```sh
